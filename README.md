### Setup

##### Prerequisites
Install [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/);

Install [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli):

    npm install -g polymer-cli

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:
    cd umeteo
    polymer serve --open

### Build

   polymer build

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled
